# Project Rules

- **No Walkthroughs**: Do not generate walkthroughs or proof-of-work artifacts unless specifically asked. Focus on speed and direct implementation.
- **UI Consistency**: Whenever creating or modifying UI components, always reference `reference_ui.html` for styling, layout, and high-contrast design patterns.
